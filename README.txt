! Before changing code, always fetch and merge code from the server to insure that you have the latest version. Before pushing your code, repeat the process and solve all conflicting changes.

-- If you want to change code, please do it in a seperate branch (i.e. dev).
-- Push the branch to the server and create a pull request so that we can see the changes and merge them on GitHub.
